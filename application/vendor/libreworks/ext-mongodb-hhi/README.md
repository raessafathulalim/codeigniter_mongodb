HHI Definitions For MongoDB HHVM Driver
=======================================

This repository contains .hhi files for the classes and interfaces provided by
the MongoDB HHVM Driver, available here:

https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hhvm-driver

HHI files are ignored by HHVM, however they give the typechecker information
about the classes and interfaces. This allows usage of the canonical PHP API at
runtime, while also giving the benefits of static type checking.
